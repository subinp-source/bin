CmsCockpit Extension

This extension is the old cmscockpit from 1808 (that was removed in 1811, it is then brought back to 1905 via Cloud Extension Pack - CEP and then to 2005) and adapted to run with Java 11 and Spring 5.
It provides only the WCMS cockpit application, without any support for LiveEdit, Multi-Country WCMS cockpit, or BTG cockpit.

This extension is already deprecated and is planned to be removed in 2105.
