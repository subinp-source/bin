integrationbackoffice.metadata.jsonTooltip=This is a dummy payload generated dynamically using the EDMX attributes. This example provides only a sample structure for the payload. The payload must be populated with data that, in certain cases, needs to be persisted and referenced. The end point may also expect a hook, which is not reflected in this dynamic payload example.
